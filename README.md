# Hacker News Enhancements

Hey there! 👋 I'm Mohamed, and I've created this collection of userscripts and userstyles to enhance my personal experience on Hacker News. These scripts add some nifty features and styling tweaks that I find useful.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Please note that these scripts are tailored to my specific preferences and may not suit everyone's taste. I strongly advise against using them unless you're absolutely sure you want the same modifications as I do. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your liking, but use it at your own risk!

## 🚀 Features

- Highlight submission authors for quick identification
- Toggle comment visibility to declutter threads
- Hide elements based on specific keywords, domains, and users
- Bypass paywalls for certain websites (use responsibly!)
- Apply a sleek Dracula-inspired color scheme

## 🎨 Customization

If you're feeling adventurous and want to customize the scripts, go ahead and tweak the code to your heart's content. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility! 😉

Remember, this is just my personal collection of enhancements. Your mileage may vary, and I take no responsibility for any unexpected side effects or sudden urges to code in the dark. Happy hacking! 🖖
